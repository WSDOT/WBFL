Graphing {#WBFL_Graphing}
================
Introduction
------------
This library provides services for creating X-Y line graphs and managing graph builders.

Line Graphs
--------------------
X-Y line graphs is the most basic plot used in engineering applications. They are used for shear and moment diagrams, moment-curvature responses, response spectra, and more.
The line graph services provide a simple framework for creating these types of plots.

Graph Manager
---------------
The GraphManager is a simple utility for managing GraphBuilder objects.

Graph Builders
--------------------
GraphBuilder objects create the graphical user interface elements and draw specialized graphs into a graphing window.
