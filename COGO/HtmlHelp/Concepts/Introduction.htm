<h1>Concepts</h1>

<p>The WBFL COGO Library is designed to be a computation engine for simple 
 coordinate geometry. The interfaces for the COGO model and its associated 
 objects should be intuitive for anyone who has used a general purpose 
 roadway design program like CAiCE or CEAL. However, the number of features 
 for WBFL COGO is much less than one of these comprehensive packages.</p>

<h2>Computational Features</h2>

<p>The WBFL COGO library is divided into two functional areas. The first 
 area is a coordinate geometry model. The coordinate geometry model is 
 used to manage geometrical object such as Points, Line Segments, Horizontal 
 Curves, Vertical Curves, and Alignments. Primitive operations may be performed 
 on the Coordinate Geometry model to locate points in the geometric space. 
 These operations include locating points by distance and direction, projecting 
 points onto geometric objects, computing the intersection point of geometric 
 objects, and dividing lines, arc, and curves.</p>

<p>The second functional area of the WBFL COGO library is Alignments. Horizontal 
 alignments can be created to model the curvilinear path of a roadway. 
 Alignments are comprised of Points, Line Segments, and Horizontal Curves 
 with or without transition spirals. A vertical profile can be associated 
 with an alignment to model the elevation along the curvilinear alignment. 
 Vertical profiles consist of Profile Points and Vertical Curves. Roadway 
 cross sections may be associated with the profile to describe the roadway 
 surface on the left and right sides of the survey line. The cross sections 
 are used to model crown slopes and superelevation transitions.</p>
