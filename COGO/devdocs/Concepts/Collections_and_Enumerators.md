Collections and Enumerators {#WBFL_Cogo_Collections_and_Enumerators}
===========================

The WBFL COGO Library makes heavy use of collections. Collections are 
 containers of indexed or keyed items. For collections of indexed items, 
 a zero based index is used.

The collection objects conform to the definition provide by Visual Basic. 
 In addition, restricted properties are provided to give C++ clients access 
 to special enumerators. These enumerators enable the C++ client to enumerate 
 the items in the container easily.
