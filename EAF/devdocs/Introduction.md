WBFL EAF {#WBFL_EAF}
========================
The WBFL EAF Library provides an Extensible Application Framework. The framework extensions the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library (thought it is not an MFC extension) for engineering applications. The extensions includes features for plugin applications, command line processing, help and documentation, application status messages, reporting, graphing, undoable editing (transactions), auto save and recovery and more.


> Implementation note
> The EAF library is not included in the WBFL namespace for consistency with traditional MFC application development. Classes start with the "CEAF" prefix which is similar to the MFC "C" and "CMFC" prefixes.
