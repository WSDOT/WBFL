<h1>Unit Server</h1>

<p>The UnitServer object is at the heart of the WBFL Unit Server component. 
 The unit server object manages the base units for an application or component 
 and provides unit conversion services.</p>

<p>In our world of component based programming, one of the primary goals 
 is to create solutions with reusable components. Many of the components 
 that perform engineering computations require numbers to be in a specified 
 unit system. The problem, by way of example, is Component A expects inputs 
 and gives outputs in Kips and Feet. Component B expects inputs and gives 
 outputs in Kilonewtons and Meters. To build an application that uses Component 
 A and Component B, you will have to coordinate the unit conversions. The 
 WBFL Unit Server solves this problem by allowing Component A and Component 
 B to communicate with you in the system of units you specify.</p>

<h2>Developing Applications</h2>

<p>When developing applications, you must create an instance of and maintain 
 a UnitServer object. Typically this is done indirectly with a UnitSystem 
 or AppUnitSystem object (for SDI or MDI applications, respectively). The 
 first order of business is to configure the unit server by setting the 
 base units for your application. To do this, simply call the <a HREF="..\Objects\UnitServer\SetBaseUnits_Method_(UnitServer_Object).htm">SetBaseUnits</a> 
 method. The base units are the internal units that your application will 
 use internally. For instance, internal units might be &quot;kg&quot;, 
 &quot;m&quot;, &quot;sec&quot;, &quot;Celcius&quot;, and &quot;Radians&quot;. 
 All other units of measure will be derived from these basic units. Force 
 is mass times acceleration so force will be kg*m/s<span style="vertical-align: super;">2</span>, 
 or Newtons. See the <a HREF="..\Examples\Custom_Base_Units.htm">Custom 
 Base Units</a> example for details.</p>

<p>Components that can be configured to communicate in the internal units 
 of your application must support the ISupportUnitServer interface. To 
 establish this communication, QueryInterface on the component for the 
 ISupportUnitServer interface and supply the component with a reference 
 to your UnitServer object. If the component does not support the ISupportUnitServer 
 interface or if you do not supply the component with a reference to your 
 UnitServer object, the component will expect data in the unit system it 
 specifies.</p>

<h2>Developing Components</h2>

<p>If you are developing a component and want to support the seemless communication 
 of data between the application and your component, implement the ISupportUnitServer 
 interface. The calling application will provide your component with a 
 UnitServer object that you use to convert all incoming and outgoing data 
 to the unit of measure the caller wants. As a component developer, you 
 don't need to know the exact units of measure the caller wants, the UnitServer 
 will handle the details of the unit conversions for you.</p>
