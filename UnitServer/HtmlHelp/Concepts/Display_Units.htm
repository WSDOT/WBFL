<h1>Display Units</h1>

<p>Most engineering components and applications work in a consistent set 
 of internal units. Often times these units are not the units the user 
 wants to work in. For example, internal to an application length might 
 be measured in inches but users want to input length in feet or meters. 
 Display units create the bridge between the units of measure the user 
 works with and the units of measure the programmer works with.</p>

<p>The display unit services provided by the WBFL Unit Server consist of 
 a display unit manager (DisplayUnitMgr or DisplayUnitMgr2), collections 
 of display units types (DisplayUnitGroup) and DisplayUnit objects.</p>

<h2>Display Unit Manager</h2>

<p>The display unit manager is responsible for managing display unit groups. 
 The display unit manager also provides methods to convert between display 
 units and base units.</p>

<p>The WBFL Unit Server implements two display unit managers, DisplayUnitMgr 
 and DisplayUnitMgr2. Both of these object manage display units exactly 
 the same. These two object differ in the way they deal with unit conversion.</p>

<p>DisplayUnitMgr is designed to work with Single Document Interface (SDI) 
 applications. In this sort of application there is a single document and 
 a single unit mode. Because there is only one document the display unit 
 manager is coupled to the document and can offer formatting and unit conversion 
 servers.</p>

<p>DisplayUnitMgr2 is designed to work with Multiple Document Interface 
 (MDI) applications. In this soft of application there can be one or more 
 documents and each document can have its unit mode set to SI or English. 
 In the MDI case, the unit mode and the display unit manager cannot be 
 directly coupled. The formatting and unit conversion tasks are handled 
 by the DocUnitSystem object.</p>

<h2>Display Unit Group</h2>

<p>It is often convienent to group display units into categories. For example, 
 an application might have two types of length input. One input represents 
 the span length of a bridge and the other represents dimensions of a girder 
 cross section. Typically you will want to present the span lengths in 
 units of feet or meters and the cross section dimensions in units of inches 
 or millimeters. Even though the physical unit type is the same (Length), 
 the display units are much different. The DisplayUnitGroup object allows 
 you to logically group different type of display units and then refer 
 to them by a simple name. In this example you might use a group called 
 &quot;LongLength&quot; and another group called &quot;ShortLength&quot;. 
 Now, when ever you want to convert a number in the &quot;LongLength&quot; 
 group, you simply use the conversion methods provided by the framework 
 and refer to the &quot;LongLength&quot; group. The display unit manager 
 takes care of the rest.</p>

<h2>Display Unit and the DisplayUnitFormatter</h2>

<p>A display unit brings together a unit of measure and formatting information 
 to create a formatted display unit string. In the example given above, 
 &quot;LongLength&quot; has a unit type of &quot;Length&quot; and a unit 
 of measure of &quot;Feet&quot; or &quot;Meters&quot;. The DisplayUnitGroup 
 for &quot;LongLength&quot; will have two DisplayUnit objects, one for 
 each unit of measure. Typically, you will want to format the display of 
 a distance in feet differently than a distance in meters. This is the 
 job of the DisplayUnitFormatter.</p>

<p>The DisplayUnit object for &quot;feet&quot; will have a reference to 
 the Unit object for &quot;feet&quot; and a DisplayUnitFormatter object 
 that knows how to format the display string. The DisplayUnitFormatter 
 object has properties such as Justification, Precision, and Width that 
 control the appearance of the formatted display unit string.</p>

<p>The AnnotatedDisplayUnit object is used for special formatting such 
 as feet and inches (10'-3&quot;) or stationing (9+45.12).</p>
