WBFL Geometry {#WBFL_Geometry}
================
Introduction
------------

This library provides geometric modeling services. The objects implemented 
 in this library are OLE Automation Compatible. This means you can use 
 the services of this library from Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, 
 Visual C++ and Java.

This library provides Geometric Primitives services, Shape Modeling 
 services, and Geometric Utility classes.

Geometric Primitives
--------------------
Geometric primitive objects include points, lines, line segments, rectangles, 
 and vectors. Primitive objects are useful for a variety of things including 
 geometric calculations, geometric modeling, and graphics.

Shape Modeling
---------------
Building on the geometric primitives, this library provides objects 
 for modeling the shapes. Geometric shapes can represents the cross section 
 of a bridge beam or a parcel of land. Every shape has a hook point. The 
 hook point is a predefined location on the shape. The shapes position 
 on the XY plane can be managed by moving the location of the hook point.

Geometric properties can be computed for shapes as well. A shape properties 
 object represents these geometric properties. Using the shape properties 
 object, you can transform the geometric properties into a coordinate system 
 of your choice.

Geometric Utilities
--------------------
Several geometric utility objects are implemented in this library. These 
 objects perform geometric manipulations such as coordinate transformations, 
 computing intersection points of line and circle, and generating coordinates. 
 Class factories are also provided to extend the capability of the geometric 
 utility objects.
