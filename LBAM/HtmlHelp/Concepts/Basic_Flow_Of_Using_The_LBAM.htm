<h1>Basic Flow Of Using The LBAM</h1>

<p>The LBAM system was designed to be as simple to use as possible, and 
 there are few restrictions as to the order of operations involved in using 
 it. However, there are some practical constraints (e.g., You must have 
 a model before you can analyze it). A rough layout of the basic flow for 
 using the LBAM is shown in the Figure below.</p>

								border-style: none;
								margin-top: 0px;

								margin-left: 0px;
								margin-right: 0px;"

<p>In general, you build a model, then ask for results. You can then edit 
 the model and request more results as needed. There is no need to call 
 methods to analyze, discretize, solve, or otherwise deal with the gory 
 details of model solution.</p>

<p CLASS=Tip>Note that this ease of use does not come without performance 
 implications. If you want optimal performance out of the analysis engines, 
 it is best to fully describe the model and all loads/loadings before you 
 request any results. Many of the engines cache results to improve performance, 
 but they cannot cache results for changes that have not occurred yet. 
 In fact, some changes in data may cause the engines to clear their caches 
 and recompute results for all loads and stages. This can result in significant 
 performance penalties.</p>

<p CLASS=Tip>Also note that the figure above shows the model being built 
 before the loads are described. This is not truly necessary. If desired, 
 you can create all of the loads first and create the Spans and Supports 
 later.</p>
