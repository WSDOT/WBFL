<h1>Types of Supports</h1>

<p>Support and TemporarySupport members come in two flavors: Idealized 
 (zero-length), and Fixed-Length. From the aspect of input, the only difference 
 between a zero-length Support and a fixed-length Support is the value 
 of the Support's Length property. If the value is 0.0, it is a zero-length 
 support. However, the two types of supports are modeled slightly differently 
 as explained below.</p>

<h3>Idealized (Zero-Length) Support Members</h3>

<p>If a Support has its Length property equal to zero, it is called a zero-length, 
 or idealized Support. A Zero Length Support simply defines the idealized 
 boundary conditions at span ends. A Zero Length Support has zero size 
 and is coincident with its bearing end.</p>

<p>The Y Translational degree of freedom must be fixed.</p>

<p>Both the X translation and Z rotational degrees of freedom can be fixed 
 or freed independently (the suport can be fixed, pinned, or roller - remember 
 Statics 101?)</p>

<h3>Fixed-Length Support Members</h3>

<p>Fixed-Length Support Members are defined by having their Length property 
 greater than zero.</p>

<p>Fixed-Length Support Members are straight, vertically-oriented beams 
 that connect at the top to Span Members.</p>

<p>Fixed-Length Support Members have two ends, a Bearing End, and a Footing 
 End. The Bearing End connects to the Span Members' end and is always located 
 above the Footing End.</p>

<p>All degrees of freedom at the Footing End are fixed.</p>

<p>The geometry of a Fixed-Length Support Member is defined by its length, 
 and horizontal inclination.</p>

<p>The section properties of a Fixed-Length Support are defined by prismatic 
 segments along its length.</p>

<p>Fixed-Length Support Members may be inclined from vertical either upstation 
 or downstation. Inclination is specified by horizontal offset.</p>
