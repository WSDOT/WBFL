<h1>Describing Models</h1>

<p>Longitudinal Bridge Analysis Models are used to model a bridge superstructure 
 for the purpose of performing a single girderline analysis. LBAM's are 
 an idealized representation of a bridge made up of beam members, distribution 
 factors, and idealized loads. LBAM's consist only of the information required 
 to analyze a bridge. They do not contain product-level information about 
 a real bridge (e.g., you can't tell what type of girders they are made 
 from, or what materials were used). LBAM's can be used to idealize and 
 analyze most types of bridges that can be modeled using the AASHTO simplified 
 (distribution factor-based) approach.</p>

<p>LBAM models are a two-dimensional representation of a girderline in 
 a bridge. Supports in the model can have zero length, or represent fixed-length 
 columns to model sidesway. Note that the supports are in the same plane 
 as the girderline, and do not accurately model a bent structure.</p>

<h2>Do I Need To Build The Model In Any Specific Order?<a NAME=Order_of_Construction></a></h2>

<p>This object model was designed to make it easy to build an LBAM model. 
 For instance, the order in which you describe the model is not important. 
 If you want, you could start out building a model by describing point 
 loads, then spans, then load combinations, then supports, then stages, 
 then boundary conditions, then superstructure members, and maybe some 
 more point loads. The order of model construction just doesn't matter.</p>

<p>However, when you request for analysis results, the model must be well-formed, 
 and if it's not, an error will occur which gives a description of the 
 problem.</p>

<h2>Model Connectivity<a NAME=Model_Connectivity></a></h2>

<p>Span and Support objects aren't directly linked together. Their relative 
 ordering in the Spans and Supports collections determines their relative 
 locations (left to right). The only constraint is that their must be one 
 more Support than there are Spans (e.g., number of spans=3, number of 
 supports=4), just like for a real bridge.</p>

<p>SuperstructureMembers describe the structural members (girders) in the 
 superstructure and are laid out from left to right in their collection 
 in the same way. As you can see in the figure above, the total length 
 of all SuperstructureMembers must be at least as long as the total length 
 of all Spans plus the left overhang dimension. A right overhang exists 
 if the total length of the SuperstructureMembers exceeds this dimension.</p>

<h2>Superstructure Definition<a NAME=Superstructure_Definition></a></h2>

<p>A collection of sequential Spans is used to define the span lengths; 
 which, of course, describes where the Supports are. The physical properties 
 of the superstructure are described by a collection of <a HREF="..\Objects\LBAM_Model\SuperstructureMember\SuperstructureMember.htm">SuperstructureMember</a>'s 
 which represent the actual beams that make up the superstructure. This 
 allows you to build bridge models such that the beams making up the superstructure 
 do not have to terminate at the supports. Examples of these types of bridges 
 are spliced girder bridges and bridges built segmentally. However, the 
 LBAM does not have direct support for incrementally launched structures.</p>

<p>Hinged spans can be modeled by placing end releases on SuperStructureMembers. 
 Hinges can be removed in subsequent stages by defining the removal stage 
 for the release.</p>

<h2>Substructure Definition<a NAME=Substructure_Definition></a></h2>

<p>The substructure of an LBAM is defined by a collection of Support objects. 
 The number of Support objects in an LBAM must be equal to the number of 
 Spans plus one. See <a HREF="Types_of_Supports.htm">Types of Supports</a> 
 for more information about defining Supports.</p>

<p>It is also possible to define <a HREF="..\Objects\LBAM_Model\TemporarySupport\TemporarySupport.htm">TemporarySupport</a>'s, 
 which are supports that can be removed from the model in a given stage. 
 <a HREF="..\Objects\LBAM_Model\TemporarySupport\TemporarySupport.htm">TemporarySupports</a> 
 are useful for modelling falsework and spliced girder configurations.</p>

<h2>Force and Deflection Models<a NAME=Force_and_Deflection_Models></a></h2>

<p>For some types of structures, the AASHTO LRFD Specifications require 
 that different section stiffness properties be used for calculation of 
 force and deflection responses. An example of this is for concrete structures 
 as outlined in LRFD, Section 5.7.3.6. For this reason, there are two different 
 types of member stiffnesses (e.g., EADefl, EAForce) in the <a HREF="..\Objects\LBAM_Model\CrossSection\CrossSection.htm">CrossSection</a> 
 object. This means that we must build different structural analysis (FE) 
 models in order to compute force and deflection responses.</p>
