<h1>What Do I Need To Know In Order to Use the LBAM?</h1>

<p>Since the LBAM is a system for performing a structural analysis of bridge 
 superstructures, you need to have a background in structural engineering/analysis 
 in order to understand the concepts presented in this document. In fact, 
 we expect that most potential users of this system will be licensed bridge 
 engineers or structural engineers who don't have much programming experience. 
 Which leads us to the next prerequisite:</p>

<p>In order to use the LBAM system, you must have a basic understanding 
 of the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM), and/or programming with 
 Visual Basic. If your knowledge of programming is limited to what you 
 learned in that FORTRAN class way back in college, you are in for a struggle. 
 Don't fret though, Visual Basic is probably the most popular programming 
 language in the world and there are lots of resources out there to help 
 you learn it. Some possibilities are:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-P><p>Take a VB class at your local college</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-P><p>Buy (and read) one of the many introduction to 
 VB books available today</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-P><p>Take one of the many courses available on-line</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-P><p>Hire a consultant</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For first-time users of the LBAM system, we recommend the VBA programming 
 environment in Microsoft Excel is a good place to get familiar with the 
 system. Excel has a decent code editor and debugger, and it integrates 
 well with the context-sensitive help provided with the LBAM system.</p>

<p>Note that Visual Basic (VB) and Visual Basic For Applications (VBA) 
 are very similar, but are not the same language. Visual Basic is a full-featured 
 programming environment that is used for creating stand-alone programs; 
 while VBA is hosted within other programs such as Word, Excel, AutoCad, 
 and Access. One good thing though: if you are familiar with one, it is 
 easy to learn the other.</p>
