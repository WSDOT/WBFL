<h1>Stage-Dependent Analyses</h1>

<p>Certain properties of the LBAM are Stage-Dependent. This allows you 
 to model many different time-dependent conditions that arise in the construction 
 of a bridge. However, this is not to say that you can model all possible 
 construction methods and situations. In the following paragraphs, we will 
 discuss features in the LBAM that help you to describe stage dependent 
 structures.</p>

<h2>What is <span style="font-style: italic;">Not</span> Stage-Dependent<a 
 NAME=What_is_Not_Stage-Dependent></a></h2>

<p>Before we talk about what properties are stage-dependent, let's first 
 talk about those properties that are not:</p>

<h3>Span Lengths and Number of Spans</h3>

<p>An LBAM has a fixed number of Spans which are fixed in length for all 
 Stages. This means that Supports stay put through the life of the LBAM. 
 However, TemporarySupports can be added to Spans and removed at a later 
 Stage, which effectively changes the number of Spans over time.</p>

<h3>SuperstructureMember Lengths and Number of SuperStructureMembers</h3>

<p>An LBAM has a fixed number of SuperstructureMembers which are fixed 
 in length for all Stages. This means that overhang lengths stay the same 
 throughout all Stages.</p>

<h3>Distribution Factors</h3>

<p>DistributionFactors are not stage-dependent.</p>

<h3>POI Locations</h3>

<p>The locations of user-defined POIs can not change over time.</p>

<h3>Live Loads</h3>

<p>The definitions of live loads are not stage-dependent. However, live 
 load effects can be computed for any stage in the model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Properties That <span style="font-style: italic;">Are</span> Stage-Dependent<a 
 NAME=Properties_That_Are_Stage-Dependent></a></h2>

<h3>Section Properties</h3>

<p>SuperstructureMembers, Supports, and TemporarySupports are made up of 
 prismatic Segments. Each Segment has a length and a CrossSection object 
 that describes its section properties. The arrangement of these Segments 
 along each member is entirely Stage-dependent. This means that section 
 properties can vary between stages.</p>

<p CLASS=Tip>Note: In general, cross section stiffnesses must increase 
 through Stages in order for a linear, static analysis to compute correct 
 results. A non-linear, iterative analysis must be performed in order to 
 correctly model the case where a structure loses stiffness through time. 
 It is not expected that the analysis engines created for the LBAM will 
 support this behavior.</p>

<h3>Loads</h3>

<p>When you describe a load on the LBAM, you assign it to a Stage and to 
 a LoadGroup. Hence any given load is only applied in a single Stage. The 
 effects of the load are accumulated through the remaining Stages if the 
 LoadGroup is not transient. If the LoadGroup is transient, its effects 
 are present only in the Stage where its loads occur.</p>

<h3>SuperstructureMember End Releases (Hinges)</h3>

<p>Releases (hinges) can be placed at either end of any SuperstructureMember 
 in an LBAM. Each time you create a release, you can also assign it a removal 
 stage. This removes the hinge for that Stage and all subsequent stages. 
 A typical use of this feature is to model structures that are Simply Supported 
 for Dead Loads and Continuous for Live Load (SDCL). Note that Hinges are 
 present in the first stage of the model until the removal stage - hinges 
 cannot be added to a model after the first stage (this would require a 
 non-linear analysis to resolve).</p>

<p CLASS=Tip>Tip: It is your responsibility to make sure that any models 
 you create can be solved by a static analysis. Analysis of unstable models 
 will result in an analysis error.</p>

<h3>TemporarySupports</h3>

<p>One or more TemporarySupports can be placed in any Span in an LBAM. 
 Each TemporarySupport has a removal Stage. This allows you to model falsework 
 that is removed during the construction sequence.</p>

<p>Note that TemporarySupports are present in the first stage of the model 
 until the removal stage - they cannot be added to a model after the first 
 stage.</p>
