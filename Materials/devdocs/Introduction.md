Introduction {#WBFL_Materials}
================
This library provides the WBFL Engineering Services Layer with engineering materials modeling services.

The engineering material modeling services provides product models for common civil engineering materials like concrete and steel.

The sign convension used for the material models is compressive stresses and strains are less than zero and tensile stresses and strains are greater than zero.
