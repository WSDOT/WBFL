Types {#WBFL_Types}
========================================================
Provides platform independent types. For example instead of using 'double' the WBFL libraries use 'Float64'. 'Float64' is a 64 bit floating point number. Using these custom types supports porting the WBFL code to different operating systems and platforms.
