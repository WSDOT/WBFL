License Notification Tools {#WBFL_Tools_License}
================================================
The WBFLTools::ARPNotice object provides a read to use license notification user interface element. This object presents the license agreement and disclaimers for acceptance by the user.

In office environments IT staff typically install software and the end user never sees the install-time license agreement. WSDOT highly recommends that the end user is presented the license agreement, and is asked to accept the terms, before running the software for the first time. 

All distributions and derivative works are required to present the license agreement. The WBFLTools::ARPNotice object is designed to make this easy to accomplish. For additional information, see \subpage WBFL_Tools_Using_the_license_notice.
