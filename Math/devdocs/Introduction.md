* Cubic and Quadratic equation solvers
* Root finding by Bisection and Brent's methods
* Solution of equations in the form g(x) = x using fixed point iteration
* Function models (linear, polynomial, piecewise, zero, and composite)
* Numerical integration by trapezoidal rule
* 1D-coordinate mapping
* Solution of system of equations with unsymmetric banded coefficient matrix.
* Calculation and comparison of capacity:demand ratio
* Numeric ranges
